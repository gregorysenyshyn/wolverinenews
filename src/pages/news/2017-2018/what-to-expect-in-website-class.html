Introduction: I, Corbin Peter, am a Grade 12 student within Wellington Heights. I’m currently enrolled within the Grade 12 Comm Tech Class. When I mention this to my parents, friends, and even fellow students, they don’t know anything about the class. I find it sad that this is the case; it teaches stuff that’s in the modern era of technology, and useful knowledge that’s used in every corner of the workforce. It’s quite helpful to the anyone and everyone. This article will show and explain exactly what Grade 12 Comm Tech has to offer to anyone and everyone.

Welcome to the World of Technology: As of the date this is published, Mr. Senyshyn is the captain of the well-oiled machine (excuse the pun). He has been the teacher for the Grade 12 course for two years now, with each year being advanced and improved upon significantly. Currently, the class runs twice a year for both semesters and is located in room 131 within Wellington Heights Secondary School. However, we will be focusing on the latest incarnation of the class which course code is IDC3O.

The Class Begins: Whether you’re in the first or second semester class, you will, like all classes, be introduced to the school rules and regulations before diving into the world of technology. After a period to be informed of the rules, you will then be placed in charge of a Nikon camera to learn how to take the perfect photo. (No, it’s not a selfie); this will come in handy throughout the course. You’ll need to compose a full slideshow of custom photos that you have taken highlighting certain aspects of a photo like the rule of thirds, exposure, focus, and more techniques. If you are concerned about this because this is a new experience for you, do not worry; Senyshyn will explain everything so it's crystal clear. After that, you’ll need to compose a list of your favourite writers and reasons why they are your favourites so that you can incorporate those strengths to your work. This will also come in handy later. Many programing tutorials and lessons will also be taught for successfully coding by Mr. Senyshyn the coding and digital creation parts of the class are arguably the most interesting parts of the class. Now it isn't as quick and hectic as it all sounds here, you’ll have the right amount of time completing each of the tasks unlike some other classes.

The Website: Now comes the juice of the meal, the Wellington Heights Website (http://wolverinenews). This is where you’ll be spending the bulk of your time slowly building and improving it more and more each week. A five hundred word article is due every Wednesday. It needs to be edited and sent to be put on to the website by programmers, which segways perfectly to my next point. After your article is finished you shall pick to be one of two roles, a computer programmer or a photographer. Since these topics were touched upon during the course, your choice is what you feel more passionate about rather than which is easier. As I stated earlier, this is the bulk of the class work; so it's good to have lots of ideas and creative thoughts on how to improve and advance the website.

Outro: In the end, it obviously is up to the reader on whether or not you’re interested in this magnificent class. However, the class is open to everyone and anyone willing to learn about the wonders of technology here at Wellington Heights.
