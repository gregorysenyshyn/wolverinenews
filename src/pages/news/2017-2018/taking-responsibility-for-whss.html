We all eat at lunch time and leave garbage but what do you think happens to the garbage that doesn't make it to the garbage can? Do they just stay in the spot that they’re left in? No: It has to be cleaned up by the custodians.

One of the responsibilities for students is to clean up after themselves, just because it’s the custodian's job to clean up the school. Some students take that for granted. We should all know that if you have garbage, you throw it in the garbage bin. Simple as that. I know that students can be lazy and say that it’s “too much work” to throw out their trash. If it’s okay for students to say that then is it okay for the custodians to say the same thing and just not do their job? Imagine how dirty the school would be if that were to happen. After talking to the custodian's about the amount of garbage left behind by students after lunch, they said it’s about 10-20% of garbage made by students. Depending what’s on the lunch menu for the day. This includes, pop cans, disposable plates, bags and other food wrappers along with popcorn. On Fridays what I have noticed is that students like to throw around their popcorn because they think it’s fun. Do you know how hard it is to clean up crushed popcorn off of the floor with a broom?

We should be grateful because in Japan they don’t have custodians in their schools. The students actually have time during school hours where they clean the school floors and anywhere else they are told to. From mopping the floors to taking out the trash, students take 30 minutes after lunch. At some schools, they take 30 minutes at any time of the day to clean their school. The reason for this is because they believe that this helps students respect their environment when it’s their responsibility to help preserve it.

Most students when they see garbage on the floors, they look at it without doing something about it. Simply picking up a piece of garbage can help the custodians and the students. Slipping on garbage can be a safety hazard. You can really slip on anything even if it’s just a wrapper from a candy package. Garbage build up in areas can lead to odor which will not smell pleasant in the hallways. Imagine walking down the hallway and smelling something really bad not knowing what it is, hey look at that it’s you lunch from last week! This is why we have custodians so we don’t always smell rotting food within our school, unless it’s in your locker.

To sum everything up students should be thinking about how the custodians feel when they have to clean up the mess that students left behind after having their lunch. Also how lucky we are to have people who actually work for cleaning up after us so we don’t have to focus on class and cleaning.
