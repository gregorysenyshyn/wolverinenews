Summer is just around the corner, and with summer comes a lot of free time for students.  Many students often find themselves wasting their summer with nothing to do. Unproductivity and boredom filled summers are the norm these days it seems. Today this article will give readers ideas to make their summer jam packed with good times.

What’s the most cliche and stereotypical summer activity you can think of? Though there’s many, what we’re focusing on today is road trips.

Featured in countless movies and shows, road trips have always been a very romanticized activity and for good reason. Nothing inspires togetherness and bonding quite like being in a car together for hours on end and reaching a place you’ve never been before.

Here’s a list of road trip destinations for students that are looking for something to do this summer.

The first destination is not far, sitting between Erin and Caledon is the Belfountain Conservation Area. This location brings you close to nature and boasts beautiful scenic views. The hikes are short but worth it for the scenery, which includes a waterfall and gardens. Entrance to the area is only a small fee.

The next location, though not really far enough to be considered a real road trip, is the Elora Gorge. The high cliffs provide scenic views for hikers, and the quarry provides a beautiful place to swim and relax.

The third location is a bit farther, around a 2 hour drive north is a very well known location, the Bruce Peninsula National Park. This is another location that brings you close to nature with beautiful views. Inside the park is Cyprus Lake Grotto, the water is beautiful and if you’re feeling adventurous you can venture into the underwater caves.

Or you can head to Collingwood to admire the Scenic Caves. Collingwood also has the longest suspension bridge in Southern Ontario, and you can go ziplining here too.

Or you could take a trip to Hamilton to admire the countless waterfalls littered around the Hamilton area.

If your looking for a long road trip, venturing up north is a must. Temagami is a beautiful area about an hour past North Bay. It has hundreds of lakes in the surrounding area and is great for fishing. The small town of Temagami is home to a large fire tower that visitors can climb at their own risk that boasts a view of the trees and lakes for as far as the eye can see.

There’s many more places in Ontario that are wonderful places for a road trip.
