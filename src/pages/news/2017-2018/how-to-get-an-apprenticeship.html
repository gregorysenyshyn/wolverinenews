stub: An apprenticeship is a formalized training program which combines on-the-job and in-school training done in a trade profession. A trade profession is a skilled job, typically requiring manual skills and special training. The apprentice is usually trained directly with a journeyperson who is someone that is recognized as a qualified and certified person in the trade. An apprenticeship can be done while you’re in high school or after you graduate. The best way for students to apply is through The Ontario Youth Apprenticeship Program (OYAP) which is a school to work organization that offers students the opportunity to work in apprenticeship occupations starting in Grade 11 or Grade 12 through the Cooperative Education program. While taking a Co-op in high school, students are not paid but earn credits instead. If the student is hired by the company they've been working at after they have finished their Co-op hours, they can get an apprenticeship where they are paid while working and being trained. There are hundreds of apprenticeship opportunities within the trades in Ontario and across Canada. When starting an apprenticeship the training will usually be done all on the job sight (the company that’s employing you) and you will be working at least 30 hours a week for that company. Apprenticeships last between 1 and 4 years.

An apprenticeship is a formalized training program which combines on-the-job and in-school training done in a trade profession. A trade profession is a skilled job, typically requiring manual skills and special training. The apprentice is usually trained directly with a journeyperson who is someone that is recognized as a qualified and certified person in the trade. An apprenticeship can be done while you’re in high school or after you graduate. The best way for students to apply is through The Ontario Youth Apprenticeship Program (OYAP) which is a school to work organization that offers students the opportunity to work in apprenticeship occupations starting in Grade 11 or Grade 12 through the Cooperative Education program. While taking a Co-op in high school, students are not paid but earn credits instead. If the student is hired by the company they've been working at after they have finished their Co-op hours, they can get an apprenticeship where they are paid while working and being trained. There are hundreds of apprenticeship opportunities within the trades in Ontario and across Canada. When starting an apprenticeship the training will usually be done all on the job sight (the company that’s employing you) and you will be working at least 30 hours a week for that company. Apprenticeships last between 1 and 4 years.

There are certain requirements you must meet before applying for an apprenticeship. To apply for an apprenticeship you need to be 16 years of age and have completed at least 16 credits towards the Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD) prior to starting the program. You also may be working towards the completion of all OSSD requirements when applying. You must be enrolled as a full time student during the program and in most cases, you are required to have taken a Co-op in high school.

If you decide to apply for an apprenticeship, you should first talk to your guidance counselor and Co-op teacher about which trade you’d like to go into. After talking to different people, you should research program opportunities for yourself. This can be done on the OYAP website. Once you’ve decided which program you’d like to apply to, create your OYAP account and fill out the application form to enrol with The Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Development. Be sure to complete all sections of the application and submit the form when you’re finished. Your application will be sent to The Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Development where they will review it with the company you applied to and decide if you are eligible for the program or not. It can take a few weeks to get a response depending on the company and trade you’re applying to but most people will either get an acceptance or refusal letter within a month.

Getting an apprenticeship can be beneficial for different people for various reasons. If you choose to start an apprenticeship, it can be helpful when it comes to expenses. In college and university you need to pay for books, meals, tuition etc. But when doing an apprenticeship you are paid for your work while learning the trade and all tools are covered by the company that is training you. Apprenticeships teach you a lot through experiencing the trade itself by being able to learn while you work. Another benefit about being an apprentice is that there are always a need for people in the trades, making it easier to find jobs in the industry.
