Everyone has different preferences when it comes to effectively organizing their work. Some people like working in a group while others prefer to do their work independently. Both working alone and on a team have their pros and cons.

Working in a group can help people work more effectively for various reasons. In a group there are plenty of ideas generated between the members since there is more than one mind brainstorming. “Two heads are better than one” is a popular phrase which means it's helpful to have the advice or opinion of a second person which is something you’ll always have while working in a group. It’s also easier to solve problems in a group since there are more people to help think of a solution. There are usually more resources when working in a group which helps the brainstorming process and the work can be done faster since there’s more people to take part. Working in a group helps you build teamwork and collaboration skills which are the ability to work effectively with others. This is important because everyone needs these skills later in life to work most jobs.

While there are many advantages for working in a group, there can also be various disadvantages. Most groups will quickly develop an initial leader who usually takes control of the work. Normally, the person who takes charge of the group will end up doing the majority of the work and leads to an unequal amount of participation. This also gives the other members a way to take credit for the work they did not do which isn’t fair to the person who actually did it. Both the quality and quantity of work varies between group members and can affect the grade of the group if they are marked as a whole. Lastly, while working in a group there is always a chance that some members may dislike each other which can lead to conflict between people. This can cause the group to lose focus and they won’t be working as effectively as they could be.

Working independently can be effective for many people and many reasons. While working alone, normally there are fewer distractions which makes it easier to concentrate on the work you’re doing. When working with other people, it’s easier to get distracted by the task they're working on instead of your own. Dr. Tim Welsh (Faculty of Kinesiology researcher at University of Calgary) explained “When an individual could see their partner actually performing the task, the partner's performance interfered with their own performance, causing them to perform more slowly”. You can work in a quiet environment and be your own boss. There are more original ideas generated while working independently and in the end you take credit for all the work. Working alone can make you feel more accomplished too.

Working independently can be effective, but like working in a group, it also has its disadvantages. While working alone there are less ideas thought of. Only one mind is doing the work and may be harder to come up with a plan. You have to do more work on your own and have no group members to help you. This can also lead to less being accomplished since you don’t have anyone there to motivate you. This can be more stressful and boring at the same time. While working alone, there is no constructive criticism being given to you which means you might not know what you’re doing wrong if there is a problem with your work.
