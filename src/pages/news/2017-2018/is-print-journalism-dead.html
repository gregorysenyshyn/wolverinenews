Newspapers were once the primary way to receive information about the world and current events, but these days all you have to do is pull out your phone and all of that is at your fingertips. Why would people spend money on a newspaper or magazine when it’ll go to waste after they read it? Is print journalism dead?

Newspapers have been around for centuries, the first weekly printed newspapers started in 1609 in Germany, long before Canada even became a real country. But as the reach of technology has increased, the need for newspapers has steadily declined. In the 1950’s when television was first introduced people no longer needed newspapers to provide their daily news, though they were still widely purchased. However in the 1990’s the internet began to become a mainstream source for information, was that the beginning of the end for newspapers?

The internet has risen and become an essential part of life in the world we know today, can you remember the last time you went through a whole day without using the internet in some way? The internet is the way of the world, every piece of information is available to you in a matter of seconds. The internet easily provides everything newspapers do except the internet is free. There’s no use for a person to buy a newspaper when they’ll inevitably throw it out if they have all the same pieces of information available on their phone without having to leave their seat.

When you think about who buys newspapers, you’ll realize that the majority of newspaper buyers are relatively old. People from older generations grew up reading newspapers and still find themselves relatively unfamiliar with the internet, hence the continued purchasing of newspapers. A Canadian study done showed that the top demographic for newspaper readers was 65+ and the second most popular being 35 to 49. The number of people under 25 who purchase newspapers is slim to none. Young people get their news on social sites and the idea of spending money on a newspaper that will only have a few stories they’ll find interesting anyway, is ridiculous. In a study done by Pew Research Center it showed that only 23% of Americans had read a print newspaper the previous day which has fallen 18% in the past decade. In the study it also showed that only 38% of Americans read a newspaper regularly though this percentage has also declined. Similar studies done also showed the same irrefutable declines in the past decade.

The reality is newspapers and magazines are a thing of the past. With the natural evolution of our society it’s easy to see that the need for newspapers is just no longer there, and in just a few year they could be completely obsolete. For years the newspaper industry has been slowly closing down, many newspapers could no longer survive as they lost readers and advertisers dropped.

Publishers must get with the times. The print newspaper industry is dying, but journalism is far from dead. Publishers must make the transition from print to online if they want to survive, it’s the way of the future.
