Wellington Heights Secondary School is home to hundreds of talented and ambitious students, and on March 26th, one student will shine a bit brighter than the rest. Owen Risidore, a twelfth grade student here at Wellington Heights, has been working on a secret project within his confined computer space in room 131- his Comm Tech class. Risidore hasn't  publicly discussed his future plans about his music in over a year. The last time it was even mentioned was back in 2016 with fellow collaborator Corby. “Dopest album 2016 its coming!” said Owen back in a press conference. Yet fans received nothing, But last week a three minute track named “Straight Outta Comm Tech” surfaced on his newly formed Soundcloud page called The Connection. The Connection is a rap duo featuring “The Rizz” (Owen Risidore) and collaborator Corby. The track garnered high praise, yet not much attention after the spotlight on Risidore faded after 2016. While fans couldn't be happier for Owens return, more than a week later, a full five track EP dropped on March 26th 2018. “It's only twelve or so minutes but I loved every minute of it!” said one ecstatic fan after the EP dropped.

But some fans are a bit uneasy. “I want to enjoy it but I can’t get past the ghostwriting allegations.” worried another fan. Right after “Dopest Album 2k18” released, rumors and articles were in a blaze, with many people speculating that the rap featuring J-Dawg on the song “Degrassi (Drake Diss)” had their lyrics written by a ghost writer. Owen recently came out in a classroom statement that he was the one who wrote J-Dawgs verses, and that there is no need for further allegations. Yet with The Connection’s spotty history of telling the truth, like failing to release Dopest Album 2k16 like promised, fans are still skeptical. Surprisingly, even more controversy followed The Connection’s sophomore EP. Drake fans are also up in arms about “Degrassi”, a diss track that targets him. Many fans felt this track was going too far by dissing another Canadian Icon. Fans felt that the song went “too far”, and more feel that the sont was distasteful. “They just don’t understand the beef we have with Drake.” replied Owen.” Its just too complicated.”  At the time of this article Drake hasn't responded and so fans and The Connection wait.

In an exclusive interview, He was quite happy with how successful the EP was doing. “Even though the CD release got delayed to Wednesday, I’m still happy with the Soundcloud release.” The CDs for Dopest Album were put on hold after a delay in shipment. However, The Connection promises for at least five to be ready by Wednesday, March 28th. Jacob Arsenault, an acclaimed critic, has given the EP a 8.5 out of 10. “I would genuinely listen to this.” he proclaimed upon hearing the EP. Only 24 hours later and The Dopest Album 2k18 on its home music streaming service Soundcloud has reached a massive total of 97 streams surpassing their estimated goal of 50 streams. “Not bad.” said Owen in a released statement. Anthony Fantano, the “world’s busiest music nerd”, has not commented on the album as of writing this article.

The Connection, as of 11 am on Tuesday March 27th, has officially retired after one EP. “We’ve hit our peak. We do better in pressured situations so we won’t return unless Drake disses us.” said through email. This may very well be the legacy for the legendary hip hop duo The Connection so go on and enjoy what may possibly be the dopest album of our generation.
