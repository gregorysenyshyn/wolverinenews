As many people know, breakfast is the most important meal of the day but most children and teens still don’t understand why they should be eating in the morning. Studies have found 77% of children in elementary school will eat breakfast, 50% in middle school and only 36% of teens eat breakfast in high school. There are various reasons behind why kids aren't eating breakfast which usually includes: being too tired to eat, they're not hungry enough in the morning, they do not like breakfast foods or they want to lose weight. This makes it harder for teens to get their daily calorie intake which should be 2000 cal/day for women and 2500 cal/day for men.

Breakfast is important because it fuels us in the morning which gives us energy that we can use throughout the rest of the day. Our bodies need important nutrients such as calcium, iron, Vitamin C, B vitamins as well as protein and fibre which are often in breakfast foods and need to be eaten as the first meal because they are less likely to be compensated for later in the day. Breakfast should be eaten within the first 2 hours of waking up for the best intake of these nutrients. It has also been shown to help improve attainment behaviour, memory and concentration levels. Breakfast restores glucose levels which is an essential carbohydrate for brain function. Research has found that children and teens who eat breakfast scored higher in academic areas and also displayed better attendance than the children and teens who had not eat breakfast.

Without eating breakfast, our bodies do not produce nearly as much energy they should be throughout the rest of the day to keep us active and functioning. If you avoid breakfast you're more likely to be irritable, stressed, and tired while our bodies will start to crave sugary or fatty foods later in the day. Researchers who work at the University of Hohenheim in Germany concluded that skipping breakfast “may in the long term lead to low-grade inflammation and impaired homeostasis” which is the regulation of blood sugar in the body. Many people believe that by skipping breakfast it will help them lose weight which is a myth. Skipping breakfast may contribute to “metabolic impairment” which increases the risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Other health issues that may occur from constantly skipping breakfast include; an increase risk of heart problems (^27%) by blockages in the arteries, migraines, effects on cognitive functioning (memory, attention span, reasoning and language), negative mood impact, effects on your metabolism and may trigger hair loss. Researchers believe that by indulging breakfast, your risk of these health conditions will decrease.

Many people have trouble eating in the morning because it makes them feel sick or it’s too harsh on their stomach which is why there are some healthy and easy to eat food choices for kids and teens who have a hard time with breakfast. This includes: smoothies, muffins, fresh fruit, granola/yogurt, eggs, cereal, and oatmeal served with milk or juice on the side. It’s especially important for children and teens to eat breakfast because at those ages, your body is still developing and should be fed breakfast every morning so that your body can benefit most from it while growing.
