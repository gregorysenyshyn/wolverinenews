The warmer weather is starting to finally show, which means summer break is very soon. This leads to people cleaning up their yards and having bonfire parties. Bonfires can be fun but it is still dangerous because it’s fire, and when not controlled properly, it can get out of hand causing accidents. Lately with the nice weather, a few accidents have been happening in the Mount Forest area, which have cost thousands of dollars worth of damage and even lives. It is important that you know how to control your fire, what is needed in order to be safe, and what to do if a fire occurs.

On May 7 at Concession 2 Wellington North, a homeowner was having a bonfire and left it unsupervised for a few minutes. Those few minutes unsupervised cost the homeowner his storage shed and three acres of grass, which was too close to consuming his house. The estimated damage cost was $250,000. Firefighters from Grand Valley, the Wellington County OPP, and the Guelph Wellington EMS all assisted in helping the Wellington North Fire Service with the fire. Charges are pending against the homeowner because he didn’t have a burn permit, or working smoke alarms.

All this nice weather is bringing people to have bonfires, but most of them are unauthorized because people are burning without a permit. Burn permits were made for a reason, and the reason why they exist is to keep people safe. The permit tells you what can be burned and what everyone is required to following when burning. The WNFS responded to nine illegal burns within 72 hours because people were burning without a permit, and was burning things not on the list. The standard cost for an open air burn permits for campfires, outdoor style fireplaces, or small brush piles are $26 a year, and are valid from January 1 to December 31. If there are any variance to the standard open air burn permit, the site of where you are burning has to be inspected, and approved. If you don’t own your property you must get written permission saying you may burn on the property. Getting burn permits is not a hard thing to get, you can go into your township to get one or register online for one. The rule is that you can only burn clean wood like twigs or small logs, as well as a following list of things everyone is required to follow. It is recommended that you burn between the hours 7pm midnight, and all open air burns must have a permit, if you are located within the township.

Bonfires can be fun as long as it is contained but many have used gasoline to light and fuel their bonfires. This is a very dangerous idea because fires can spread fast, but adding gasoline makes it faster. There was an incident near Fort Pierce on New Year’s Eve where a 14-old girl Layne Chesney, who is in medically induced coma, with 95% of her body burned. She was trying to pour more gasoline on the bonfire to fuel it, but the can exploded covering her with gasoline which caught on fire. She suffered from third-degree burns.
Many more people have been burned just like Layne Chesney, because they pour gasoline on their bonfires to fuel it and the fumes from the can get sparked. Causing the fire to go into the gas can and explode, covering anyone close to the can in burning gasoline.

Fire is very dangerous and should be taken seriously when around, although having a bonfire can be fun, as long as everyone follows the rules. Don’t pour gasoline or any flammable material on a bonfire, and have someone watching it at all times, unless you want to experience what happened to that homeowner on Concession 2. It takes a very short amount of time for a fire to spread, which could consume your house, or someones life, be careful when dealing with fire and be responsible. Make sure everyone is safe and no one has to be escorted to the hospital, due to something that could have been avoided.
