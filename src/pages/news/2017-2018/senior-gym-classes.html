**Grade 12 Fitness (Mixed Gender)**: During the course of the semester, students will be focusing on the approach to healthy active living. Students will be given the opportunity to construct their own workout plan with the knowledge they are provided in the class; much like the senior boys and girls gym class.

**Grade 11 and 12 Outdoor Education**: Grade 11 outdoor Ed, is very much focused on developing healthy active living concepts. This course offers students the ability to go camping, canoeing, hiking, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, swimming, orienteering, survival skills and first aid.

**Sports and Society**: In Sports and Society, students will be exploring sports and athletics in history and the differences between cultures.

They will also learn the importance of personal goals and healthy living, along with the differences between amateur and professional sports.

**Health for Life**: In this class, students will examine their own healthy living practices and behaviours, as well how those factors contribute to the development of a healthy community. This course helps to emphasize the idea of cognitive, spiritual, and social aspects to living healthy. Students will be given the skills to not only make healthy decisions, but develop their own plans to stay on track.

**Kinesiology**: Kinesiology focuses on students learning how human movement, systems, factors and principles are involved in human development. Students will be taught the effects of physical activity, the evolution of physical activity, and the factors that influence someoneâ€™s individual participation in physical activity. This course, is meant to prepare students who plan to go to University for physical education, kinesiology, medical, recreation, and sport administration.
