The Internet and the Music Business have a rocky relationship for the past two decades. With the rise of file sharing in the early 2000s to legal streaming services, mainstream artist still have no idea how to use the internet. On the other hand, independent artists have been on the rise; with groups like Car Seat Headrest, BROCKHAMPTON, and others finding popularity thanks to services like YouTube and Bandcamp. Recent music trends like “Mumble Rap” and “Emo Rap” have started exclusively on places like World Star Hip Hop and Soundcloud. But one question remains, what about physical media?

With the recent bankruptcy of HMV Canada in 2017 (not to be confused with its UK counterpart) and with places like Best Buy discontinuing the sales of CDs, it seems like compact discs are slowly becoming obsolete in a world of music streaming and file sharing.  The Record Industry Association of America (RIAA) recently reported that only ninety nine million CDs were sold in the US this year, a far cry from selling almost a billion during the peak years of the compact disc.

However, one physical format is currently springing back into pop culture. Vinyl records have been rising in sales since 2008, with fourteen million records being sold last year alone. From mall chains like Sunrise Records and Urban Outfitters to normal brick and mortar stores like Royal Cat Records in Guelph, it seems that more and more stores are starting to carry records and record players/accessories. Annual events such as Record Store Day and with cheaper record players coming out of the woodwork, it seems that it might be more than a fad. One question remains, however, how does this affect aspiring artists in the Mount Forest area?

Disregarding the cost of actually making the music itself, the aspiring artist/band has a few options. The cheapest option is to put it on a free streaming service, like Soundcloud or Bandcamp. While this option is free, you’re not earning a lot of money, or any money at all, in some cases. While Bandcamp does allow a paywall, it might not be a good idea for a band that’s just starting out. Even then, it’s still easy for someone who bought the files to upload it to a file sharing service, like MEGA or Mediafire. The bright side is that it exposes your music to the world without having to use a middleman to put it online. Sites like Bandcamp and Soundcloud have a giant user base, especially the latter. This could lead into your music exposed to the right people, like record label executives. But like I said, most artists make little money this way; it’s more for exposure. This could turn off some people, especially if their lives depend on their art.

Another option is to use a third party service to upload your music on commercial streaming services like Spotify and Google Music. There are a lot of companies that do this, each with a flat price rate. Some services like DistroKid make you pay yearly, while others like TuneCore make you pay per album. Some are better than others though, and it’s really your decision on what service you want to use. Like with Soundcloud and Bandcamp, your music gets exposed to a large user base, though not as big as a free streaming service like Soundcloud. Unlike Soundcloud however, you actually get paid for your work. This comes with a catch, as they Spotify pays only .0084 cents per stream. If you’re not well known, you’re not going to make a lot of money, even if you make some at all. Forget about breaking even, some artists are lucky to get $2. While some of these companies also puts your music on iTunes for people to buy, it might not make as much money since iTunes only pays an artist less than one cent per song. While it could be a good mix between exposure and money, it’s not worth it for a band trying to make a name for themselves.

Then there’s actually releasing music on a physical format. Burnable CDs are incredibly cheap in bulk; a 50 pack of cds can only cost $22, with 100 packs going for $50. While it might be a big investment for some people, it’s still worth it. It relies on a “do it yourself” ethic. You can set the prices and how it’s sold, either online or at shows. It’s a great option of your local area has a music scene, or to even sell around school. There’s only one problem, not a lot of people use CDs anymore. Laptops and pre-built computers got rid of CD drives years ago, and newer cars don’t even have a CD player. While some people might just buy it to support you and your band, there is still a very small group of people that use it, which means that not a lot of people will get exposed to your music. Unless you’re willing to ship CDs online, then forget about international exposure.

Finally, there’s hopping on the Vinyl bandwagon and pressing your own records. Just as a warning, this is incredibly expensive. First is picking through a handful of factories in Canada. Almost all of them are either in Toronto or Vancouver, the closest one to Mount Forest being Precision Record Pressing in Burlington. Next, they have to find out if they even want to deal with you. Most planting presses only deal with record labels. Microforum Vinyl, for example, only deals with labels like Dine Alone Records and True North Records. Unless you’re really lucky, you might not even get to make a deal with them. Finally, the cost. While it depends on the factory, even a dozen normal record can cost from $500 to even $1000. That’s ridiculous for an artist trying to start out. Unless you have some sort of trust fund, there’s no way someone starting out could pay those prices for something that might not sell. It’s just a stupid move. While people are buying more records, it’s mostly well known artists that benefit from record sales. Even then, it’s still a very limited market. Exposure is non existent except for that one dude that hunts for every record in existence. It’s just a dumb move to start pressing records from the get-go, if you can do so.

This article isn’t here to tell you what to do, you can take this info any way you like. This article is to help people who are thinking into getting into the music business, and what options they have. You don’t have to go with just one option, you could go with two, or three of them. It all depends on your financial situation and how much you’re dedicated to getting your music out there. Hopefully, this article is beneficial to you or your band in some way.
