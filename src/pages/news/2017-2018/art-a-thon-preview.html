<h4>Before Art-a-Thon/What Art-a-Thon is</h4>
Art-a-Thon is a school event held in the art room where everyone makes some kind of piece of art and the next day it gets auctioned off in the school. Some of the things you can do at Art-a-Thon includes drawing, painting, spray painting, clay, printmaking, ink art, and any kind of art you can think of. Art-a-Thon gives the students the opportunity to really express themselves through the art they make. It allows them to experiment and try new things from 12 pm to 12 am. It is a full day event but you don’t have to stay the entire event, you can let the teacher know you are leaving. Food and art supplies are all supplied, that is why you have to pay to do Art-a-Thon, because you pay for the supplies you use, plus dinner, which is only $20. The rules in Art-a-Thon are  that all art pieces are to be left at the school for the auction, and no cat naps during the event. Other things that you should do is at least make one piece of art, and simply have fun. Ms. McEwan is the teacher in charge and encourages everyone to try Art-a-Thon, because it is a really fun event and is worth staying up late on a school day.

<h4>During Art-a-Thon</h4>
	Twelve o’clock hit and we had about twenty people doing Art-a-Thon this year, unlike the past few years. The past few years there were more people, unlike this year the art room was somewhat crowded, but not like the past few years. There was plenty of supplies for everyone to use, and Ms. McEwan had music playing the entire time. The most popular art style that many were doing was painting compared to all the other things you can do at Art-a-Thon, but drawing was second. We had people making original pieces which really showed their personality and with everyone making such amazing art, it is really inspiring seeing all these artworks everyone was working hard at. Which made it easier for some people, more than others to get ideas on what to make. Brianna Dyksterhuis commented “Yeah, because it inspires you to make stuff”, while others like Alesha Ferguson said “No, it’s hard because you don’t want to copy people”. But that still didn’t affect everyone since there are so many pieces of art. There were a few messes made with the paint but there wasn’t that big of a mess, just a few splatters on the tables. At about 6 pm the pizza arrived for everyone, which there was hawaiian, pepperoni, extra cheese, and veggie pizzas from Matteo’s Pizza.

<h4>After Art-a-Thon</h4>
Art-a-Thon was a lot of fun for everyone and very tiring. But “Not many this year compared to the past years. It dwindled over the years, but I always have older kids who loved Art-a-Thon and would get upset if there was no Art-a-Thon” says McEwan. For that reason we still do Art-a-Thon even when there is only a little number of people doing it. Art-a-Thon is an even everyone should at least try, it is a really fun event. This years Art-a-Thon went really well even with the lack of numbers, many people enjoyed doing it and made awesome artwork. Brittney Ellsworth said, “It went really good, there was a lot of good artwork. It was so much fun and I’m bloody exhausted, but it was worth staying up late”.
There was a total of about ninety one pieces of artwork made by the students, there isn’t as many as the past years. But all of them will go into the school auction which starts tomorrow, Friday the eleventh and will run until Tuesday the fifthteeth. Start bidding on the art pieces you like so you can get them, everyone worked really hard on them. When the next Art-a-Thon comes around, hopefully more students will sign up, because it really is an amazing event to be apart of.
