Bullying is probably one of the worst things in the world, and every time we try to stop it, it continues to keep happening. Schools almost everywhere have an anti-bullying week, and yet it does nothing to stop bullying. Physical bullying may not be seen as often as it used to at school, but verbal and cyberbullying are happening all the time, no matter what people do to try and stop it.This is a problem that feels like it will never end. It’s affecting people in a bad way, and can eventually lead to suicide.

What is cyberbullying? It’s using technology to bully another person. It can happen a lot easier now that there are hundreds of social media platforms to communicate through. Instagram, SnapChat, Facebook, and Twitter are pretty much the main four. It can also happen though YouTube, emails, and texting. Some effects of being bullied include depression, anxiety, and other stress disorders, all effecting both the victim and the bully. Signs of cyberbullying include being secretive of their online life, not wanting to be around family or friends, avoiding school, grades slipping, changes in sleep, behavior, mood, or appetite, not wanting to be on any electronics, and avoiding conversations about social media. Ways to try and stop it includes blocking the bully on whatever social platform they are using and telling an adult about it. Whether it’s a parent or a teacher at school, tell someone. Better yet, tell the school's guidance counselor. They know how to help.

Verbal bullying is similar to cyberbullying, the only difference being the fact that cyberbullying is using electronics. This form of bullying is when the bully either talks about the victim behind their back or directly to the victim, which is one of the ways that start the physical fighting. Effects include low self esteem and depression. It’s harder to detect if someone has been bullied verbally because there is no physical harm. Some ways to deal with the bully are ignoring them, remain calm, focus on something happier, and tell someone. Again, it doesn’t have to be a parent, it can be a teacher or even an adult who is a really close friend.

Physical bullying, as said before, isn’t seen as much as it used to be at schools. Physical bullying isn’t just hitting and kicking, but it can also be when the bully steals from the victim or destroys something of theirs. Physical bullying also includes sexual harassment, which isn’t a topic most people like to talk about, but it’s still out there and needs to stop. Signs of physical bullying include coming home from school with bruises and cuts, having damaged items like clothing, frequently saying they’re not feeling well before going to school, skipping certain classes, acting depressed, avoiding others, mood swings, wanting to run away from home, and talking about suicide or harming others. Physical bullying is probably the worst out of all three, but with so much social media and technology around, physically interacting with people is seen less often. People would rather text than get up off their butt and going out to meet someone.

This all needs to stop. Depression and suicide are both side effects of verbal bullying, cyberbullying, and physical bullying. These are probably the worst side effects because high levels of depression can lead to suicide, and once they commit suicide, there’s no way back. Bullying can lead to that, which is why it needs to stop. Being the bully and knowing the fact that the harsh words and threats that were said lead the victim into killing them self, the bully might not want to live with them self and that could lead to suicide as well. It will end up being a chain reaction if the bullying gets that bad. A good way to try to get this to stop would be to educate students a little more, telling them what can happen to the victim when they are bullied so harshly.
