March may be home to many things: the start of Spring March Break and the countdown to Easter just to name a few. At Wellington Heights Secondary School, however, March is the month when the Spirit Committee and Student Council create the magical seven days students have come to know as Spirit Week. Current student of Wellington Heights and Grade Ten rep on Student Council, Riley McLellan, sat down with me to discuss and explain the different and various events of Spirit Week that flooded the school with pride. 2018 isn't the first year for the school wide event though. Throughout the week, every day is a different way to show off school spirit. Monday is Jersey Day, where students get to ear any jersey from their favorite sports team! Tuesday is Clothespin Day. Everyone gets one clothespin and students try to take as many of them from other students to gain the most throughout the day. Wednesday is Wolverine Wednesday, where students show off their favourite Wellington Heights Secondary School attire to represent our favourite school. Thursday would obviously be Throwback Thursday. Students dress up as their favourite past icons for the whole day. Finally Friday is Rainbow Day. On Rainbow Day, students get together plan to all dress up as each colour of R.O.Y.G.B.I.V. to make a human rainbow.


Now if you didn't know and therefore couldn't participate this year, now you know! Now with the Wellington Heights small but mighty school student population, the turnout was slightly underwhelming and “under projection” according to Riley McLellan. “It was great for those who participated in the amazing events! I am hoping for more participating next year!” she acknowledged in terms of the resulting turnout after the week had finished. Now in return, for participation other than representing your school you could have been eligible for prizes. On Tuesday (Clothespin Day), if you went to the Office with the most clothespins at the end of the day, you could have gotten chocolate. Now if you were a real Wolverine and participated every single day, you could have been eligible for free Grilled Cheese on Friday at lunch, compliments of Student Council.

Many people have their favourite spirit day within Spirit Week, mine personally being Throwback Thursday. I love seeing all the old costumes and icons coming to life in our own halls! A close second being Wolverine Wednesday because it shows off everyone’s Wolverine love and loyalty, even the Teachers get in on it. “My favourite day out of the entire week would have to be Friday [Rainbow Day] just because it was fun to hang with friends and involve all students from Wellington Heights,” continued Riley sharing her love for Spirit Week. Now the big question on everyone's mind is “Will Spirit Week come back to Mount Forest in 2019?” According to Riley McLellan, it will. “I am truly excited about it. It will be even better next year. Or at least that's what we’re anticipating.” Riley replied as the interview concluded. To all who participated this year, WHSS thanks you; and to those who didn’t, mark your calendars for next year!
